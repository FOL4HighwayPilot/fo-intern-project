# Freespace Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)

## Build

1. In order to clone the repo to your local computer:

    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cakirogluozan/fo-intern-project
    ```

    or directly download from the button (but it is not recommended.)

2. (Optional) It is suggested to use virtual environment, in the root directory:
    - create a virtual environment:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

    - activate the virtual environment:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - deactivate the virtual environment:

        ```bash
        deactivate
        ```

    > YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY FOR THIS COMMANDS.

3. Install required libraries:

    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Project

[Click on this link](https://youtu.be/i_rToxP3Txo) for a video that briefly explains the difference between machine learning and deep learning. After watching this video please search and answer the following questions:

- What is Machine Learning?
- What is Unsupervised vs Supervised learning difference?
- What is Deep Learning?
- What is Neural Network (NN)?
- What is Convolution Neural Network (CNN)?  Please give 2 advantages over NN.
- What is segmentation task in NN? Is it supervised or unsupervised?
- What is classification task in NN? Is it supervised or unsupervised?
- Compare segmentation and classification in NN.
- What is data and dataset difference?
- What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in terms of dataset?

## Data Preprocessing

### Extracting Masks

- What is color space ?
- What RGB stands for ?
- In Python, can we transform from one color space to another?
- What is the popular library for image processing?

In this part of the project, we want you to convert every JSON file into mask images:

1. Move json files into data/jsons folder.
2. Open src folder and run `[json2mask.py](https://youtu.be/p_JnbbSAxmU)` :

    ```bash
    cd src/
    python3 json2mask.py
    ```

3. To check mask files, run `mask_on_image.py` :

    ```bash
    python3 mask_on_image.py
    ```

- What do you think these masks will be used for? (Feature ? Label ?)

### Converting into Tensor

Before go on, please search and answer following questions:

- Explain Computational Graph.
- What is Tensor?
- What is one hot encoding?
- What is CUDA programming? Answer without detail.

The images and masks refer to "features" and "labels" for Segmentation. To feed them into the Segmentation model, which will be written in PyTorch, we need to format them appropriately. In this part, we will solve this issue. In the `preprocess.py`, there are two helper functions:

1. To convert images to tensor, we need  `tensorize_mask(.)`. For this complete `torchlike_data(.)`
2. To convert masks to tensor, we need `tensorize_mask(.)`. For this, complete `one_hot_encoder(.)`

At the end of the task, your data will be ready to train the model designed. We can use these functions!

> The above operations are mandatory for our task. In addition to these, other preprocessing techniques can be performed.

## Design Segmentation Model

Before go on, please search and answer following questions:

- What is the difference between CNN and Fully CNN (FCNN) ?
- What are the different layers on CNN ?
- What is activation function ? Why is softmax usually used in the last layer?

There is a script to design our model: `model.py`. In this script, we could program our model. This will require research. To visualize your model at the end, you can use [this](http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/) website. 

## Train

Before go on, please search and answer following questions:

- What is parameter in NN ?
- What is hyper-parameter in NN ?
- We mention the dataset and we separate it into 2: training & test. In addition to them, there is a validation dataset. What is it for?
- What is epoch?
- What is batch?
- What is iteration? Explain with an example: "If we have x images as data and batch size is y. Then an epoch should run z iterations."
- What Is the Cost Function?
- The process of minimizing (or maximizing) any mathematical expression is called optimization. What is/are the purpose(s) of an optimizer in NN?
- What is Batch Gradient Descent & Stochastic Gradient Descent? Compare them.

We prepare a `train.py` script that combines all our work & techniques mention in the questions. Play with hyper-parameters and examine their effects! Enjoy 🙂
